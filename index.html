    <button onclick="toggleSection('ram-info')">RAM</button>
    <div id="ram-info" class="accordion-content">
        <h2>RAM</h2>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>RAM, or random access memory, is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and program instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly during operation.</p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>RAM modules consist of integrated circuits (ICs) that contain memory cells arranged in a grid. Each cell stores a single bit of data, and the entire grid is accessed simultaneously.</p>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>RAM plays a crucial role in determining a computer's performance and multitasking capabilities. More RAM allows the computer to run more programs simultaneously without slowing down, improving overall responsiveness.</p>
